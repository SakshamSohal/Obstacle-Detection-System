 Arduino Code Summary

The Arduino sketch reads distance from the sensor and lights the appropriate LED:
- **Green**: Safe (>100 cm)
- **Yellow**: Caution (50â€“100 cm)
- **Red**: Danger (<50 cm)

  Summary: A modular ultrasonic obstacle detection system with Arduino Nano as the Microcontroller unit. Developed an Arduino code for this detection system as well as designed a custom made PCB ready for fabrication.
